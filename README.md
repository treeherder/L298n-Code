L298n-Code
==========

This is a repository of code for different manifestations of L298n.
currently working for two motors at 4A each with bridged controllers.

when operating at 4a there is a lot of voodoo with mirroring the direction pins, as not to short the board.  Please take this into consideration when attempting hacks on this circuit.
